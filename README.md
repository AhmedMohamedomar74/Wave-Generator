# Wave Generator Project

Welcome to the Wave Generator project! This project provides a powerful tool for generating a variety of waveforms using a microcontroller and a graphical user interface (GUI) developed with PyQt5. The device can generate waveforms such as sine, square, triangle, and staircase waves, with customizable frequency and amplitude.

## Features

- **GUI**: The intuitive GUI allows you to select the type of waveform, set the amplitude and frequency, and control the microcontroller with ease.
- **Waveform Selection**: Choose from various waveforms such as sine, square, triangle, and staircase.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust the amplitude and frequency of the selected waveform to suit your needs.
- **Communication**: The GUI communicates with the microcontroller via UART using the `serial` library.
- **Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)**: The microcontroller sends the received information to the DAC, which generates the desired waveform.
- **Oscilloscope Representation**: The output waveform can be visualized using an oscilloscope for verification and analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5 library
- Serial library
- A compatible microcontroller with UART support
- An oscilloscope for waveform visualization

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AhmedMohamedomar74/Wave-Generator.git]
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install PyQt5 pyserial
    ```

## Usage

1. **Connect the microcontroller**: Ensure that the microcontroller is connected to your system via a serial port (e.g., USB).
2. **Run the GUI**:
    ```bash
    python GUI.py
    ```

3. **Select parameters**: In the GUI, choose the type of waveform, set the amplitude and frequency.
4. **Generate waveform**: Click the button to send the parameters to the microcontroller.
5. **Visualize waveform**: Observe the generated waveform on an oscilloscope.
